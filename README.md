# Sign-language-detection
A CNN-based hand sign language classifier using Sign Language MNIST dataset.
# Sign Language Detection Using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets A–Z from image data.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (upcoming for real-time webcam input)
- Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
- Sign Language MNIST (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

## ✅ What’s Done
- Data preprocessing
- CNN model training
- Achieved [your_val_accuracy]% accuracy on validation set

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- Live hand gesture recognition using webcam + OpenCV
- Deploy as a Streamlit app
- Add UI for real-time demo
